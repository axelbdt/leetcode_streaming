# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/)

There are a total of <code>numCourses</code> courses you have to take, labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>numCourses - 1</code>. You are given an array <code>prerequisites</code> where <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that you **must**  take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code>.

- For example, the pair <code>[0, 1]</code>, indicates that to take course <code>0</code> you have to first take course <code>1</code>.

Return <code>true</code> if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= numCourses <= 2000</code>
- <code>0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000</code>
- <code>prerequisites[i].length == 2</code>
- <code>0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> < numCourses</code>
- All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique** .
