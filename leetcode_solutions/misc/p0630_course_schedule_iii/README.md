# [630. Course Schedule III](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/description/)

There are <code>n</code> different online courses numbered from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>. You are given an array <code>courses</code> where <code>courses[i] = [duration<sub>i</sub>, lastDay<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicate that the <code>i^th</code> course should be taken <b>continuously</b> for <code>duration<sub>i</sub></code> days and must be finished before or on <code>lastDay<sub>i</sub></code>.

You will start on the <code>1^st</code> day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.

Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: courses = [[100,200],[200,1300],[1000,1250],[2000,3200]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are totally 4 courses, but you can take 3 courses at most:
First, take the 1^st course, it costs 100 days so you will finish it on the 100^th day, and ready to take the next course on the 101^st day.
Second, take the 3^rd course, it costs 1000 days so you will finish it on the 1100^th day, and ready to take the next course on the 1101^st day.
Third, take the 2^nd course, it costs 200 days so you will finish it on the 1300^th day.
The 4^th course cannot be taken now, since you will finish it on the 3300^th day, which exceeds the closed date.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: courses = [[1,2]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: courses = [[3,2],[4,3]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= courses.length <= 10^4</code>
- <code>1 <= duration<sub>i</sub>, lastDay<sub>i</sub> <= 10^4</code>
